# VA PHASER Project – Sample Documentation

## Introduction

The **PHASER (Pharmacogenomic Testing for Veterans)** pilot project was a collaboration between the **VHA (Veterans Health Administration)** and **Sanford Health Care** in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

The objective of the project was the implementation of **PGx (Pharmacogenomic) testing** at 100 VHA Medical Centers across the United States to provide **preemptive testing for Veterans at no cost**, using existing **VistA/CPRS functions and infrastructure**.

This collaboration was funded entirely through a generous donation from **Denny Sanford and Sanford Health**.

## Role and Involvement

I was involved full-time in the project from **2019 through 2022**, with additional **part-time contract work in 2023**. My position was funded by the donation mentioned above through the **Institute for Medical Research (IMR)**.

For VHA purposes, I was classified as a **WOC (Worker Without Compensation)** at the **VHA Medical Center in Durham, NC**. As the program grew, additional project staff funded through IMR were added.

## Early Project Team

In **2019**, the PHASER project team consisted of just four people:

- **Dr. Deepak Voora** – National Program Director  
- **Dr. Jill Bates** – Clinical Pharmacy Specialist  
- **Jennifer Chapman** – National Project Manager  
- **[Author]** – National Deployment Coordinator  

Volunteer **VHA CACs (Computer Application Coordinators)**, **LIMs (Laboratory Information Managers)**, and other VHA employees at the **Durham VA Medical Center** and other VA Medical Centers nationwide also contributed significantly.

Staff from **Sanford Health Care** were deeply involved in getting the project up and running.

## Project Transition and Current Status

My full-time involvement ended in **2022**. During **2023–2024**, the project transitioned from a **pilot program** to a **fully funded program** staffed by regular VHA employees.

The PHASER program is now active at **over 120 VHA Medical Centers** across the United States.
